\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit tests document our units. Comments help with this.
    \item Unit tests should be highly readable.
    \item Think of them as an executable specification. Tests document the
        behavior of the code in a form you can execute.
    \item Demonstrates how a unit is intended to be used, how to construct
        it, call the method, what kind of arguments, what kind of results.
