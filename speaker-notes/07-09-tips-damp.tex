\section{Tips: DAMP vs DRY}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't Repeat Yourself.
    \item Declarative And Meaningful Phrases
    \item Each test is an isolated chapter in your test book. If removing a
        piece of logic hurts the readability, then don't remove it.
    \item From a maintenance perspective, don't centralize a piece of logic that
        can't be changed on it's own.
\end{itemize}
