\section{Purpose: Better Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Anecdote about PDF Form Filler being untestable.
    \item Well designed code is testable. If your code is hard to test, it is
        not well designed.
    \item Decompose the problem into units that are independently testable.
        (loose coupling)
    \item Forces thinking of interface seperately from implementation.
    \item Just the discipline of writing unit tests helps with better design.
\end{itemize}
