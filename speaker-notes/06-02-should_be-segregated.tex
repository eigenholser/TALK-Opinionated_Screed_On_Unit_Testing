\section{Unit Tests Should Be Segregated}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit tests and integration tests should be segregated.
    \item They serve different purposes. Mingling them makes it impossible to
        run them separately.
    \item Integration tests require external dependencies that are difficult to
        implement in a developer environment.
    \item During development, devs should be running unit tests often. Segregation
        of unit and integration tests reduces friction.
\end{itemize}
