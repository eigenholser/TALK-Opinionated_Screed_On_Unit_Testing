\section{UT Are Not IT}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wife asked ``what does a unit test do...''
    \item Two distinct kinds of tests: Unit tests and integration tests.
    \item Unit tests test our own units of code, hopefully isolated.
    \item Integration tests, also often called ``system'' or ``functional''
        tests, are full stack tests winding it's way through all of our code
        paths.
    \item Integration tests are often fragile.
