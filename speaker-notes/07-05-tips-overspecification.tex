\section{Tips: Overspecification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Leads to tests coupling strongly to production code and limiting
        ability to refactor.
    \item Sign of this is testing implementation details instead of the overall
        behavior.
    \item Overusing mocks is an indicator of overspecification.
    \item Prefer stubs over mocks as much as possible.
    \item Test should focus on testing the results of a function instead of the
        internal actions. Not always possible. Refer to design.
\end{itemize}
