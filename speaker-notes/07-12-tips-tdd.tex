\section{Tips: Test Driven Development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does not mean Test Deficit Disorder.
    \item Test last: Risks, design problems and bugs discovered late. Can
        descend into frustrating spiral of debugging and rework.
    \item Test last leads to heavy refactoring burdens.
    \item You might not leave time for adequate test design, leading to being
        rushed. May miss important cases.
    \item Test first? I haven't even figured out what to name stuff yet...
    \item Test first forces you to specify what you are building in advance
        of building it.
    \item Risk of rework. Mini waterfall. Discoveries during development that
        make you want to iterate.
    \item Test driven development. Designing tests and code together.
    \item Allow the design of the tests and the code emerge as you develop.
    \item TDD, ahhh, nirvana. Iterative cycle. Helps guide to clear design.
    \item Poorly designed code is hard to test.
    \item If writing unit tests is hard, your code is probably poorly designed.
\end{itemize}
