    \item Some devs don't like code coverage.
    \item I get a kick out of seeing my reports improve.
    \item Ideas for tests often come from the coverage report.
    \item How do you know what you're really testing?
    \item Code coverage reports help reason about design and guide refactor.
    \item Spot trends in testing coverage over time.
    \item Test quality != code coverage.
